What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

>> "git init" creates a repository.
>> A hidden folder ".git" is created in the directory and the new repository is
>> initialized, containing all the files and sub-directories of that directory.
>> We need to initialize the directory so that it can store all the metadata
>> of the newly created repository and track all the files in that directory,
>> using the ".git" folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

>> Staging Area is an intermediate platform where all the files that the
>> programmer wants to commit can be added and only the specified files will
>> be committed, giving the programmer a fine grained control over the commits
>> to be added to the repository.
>> Commits made should be logically independent i.e. one commit per logical
>> change. So, instead of committing the entire directory by calling "git commit"
>> small changes can be committed through the use of staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

>> Staging area allows us to add individual files, to which a logical change has
>> been made, Instead of committing the entire working directory every time a
>> change has been made to any of the files in the directory. Staging area allows
>> us to document these individual changes with commit messages.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

>> Diagrams help visualize the diiferent commits created across a project's history,
>> the parent commit of each commit and a reachablilty of commits across the timeline.
>> Diagrams also pinpoint exact location of diversion of a branch from another.

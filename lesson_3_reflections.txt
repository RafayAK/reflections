When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

>> A remote reposistory is created when a project or project branch needs to
>> be hosted on GitHub. This could be for backup, code-sharing or collaborating 
>> purposes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

>> Pulling changes manually gives you control over what changes of the remote
>> should be reflected in your local repository. Automatic syncing with remote
>> may add changes to local repository that you may not need at that point in 
>> time, disrupting your workflow.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

>> Forks are copies of repos GitHub makes under your account on the Github servers
>> without pulling down the repo locally, first. Forks give due credit to the 
>> orginal creator of the repo.
>> Clones are copies of repos you make form GitHub by pulling down the code form the 
>> repo locally on to your machine.
>> Branches are subsections of your repository containing experimental changes, hot-fixes,
>> new features etc. not currenty part of your production code(i.e master branch)
>>
>> Forks are used when you want to make changes to someone else's repo. Clones are 
>> used when you want to pull down a repo locally to your machine. Branches are used
>> to create subdivisions in the repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

>> Last known state of the remote lets us know how up-to-date or out-of-sync our local 
>> repo is compared to the remote repo. Further, using command "git fetch" Git can pull the 
>> changes made by collaborators ,since the last time you pulled or pushed, into a new branch 
>> (origin/branch_name) so that you may inspect the changes made to the remote before merging your code.

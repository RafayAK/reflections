When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

>> A remote reposistory is created when a project or project branch needs to
>> be hosted on GitHub. This could be for backup, code-sharing or collaborating 
>> purposes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

>> Pulling changes manually gives you control over what changes of the remote
>> should be reflected in your local repository. Automatic syncing with remote
>> may add changes to local repository that you may not need at that point in 
>> time, disrupting your workflow.
